# EndermanTechMod
My first mod. It's gonna be a End themed tech mod (Not  like EnderIO btw)

This mod is gonna work by getting energy from the void

You can extract the void in the end to get a fluid version of it. With this fluid you can power different machines of the mod. You will be even able to turn it into RF/FE.

This mod will also improve the End. You are gonna be able to trade with Endermen for useful items, like pearls and items from the mod.

I also want to add a bit of magic to it, like Botania. I plan on adding a boss, some magic related stuff, new structures and maybe a new dimension.

I hope I'm able to pull this off. I've tried to code many mods but I have always given up with them and not even releasing them or adding complicated stuff like you see in most quality mods.
